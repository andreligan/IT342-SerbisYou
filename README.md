### About Me:
Hi! I am Michael Andre B. Ligan, a third-year student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. I hail from Poblacion, Dalaguete, Cebu, though I am currently residing in Guadalupe, Cebu City. 🏠🌍

I have a wide range of interests that keep me engaged during my free time. I enjoy playing online games 🎮, particularly those that challenge my strategy and teamwork skills. When I’m not gaming, you’ll find me binge-watching Netflix movies and series 📺, where I love immersing myself in different genres and storytelling styles.

Another hobby of mine is cooking 🍳, and I love experimenting with new recipes or creating fusion dishes 🍴.

In terms of my passion and career aspirations, I am deeply interested in video editing 🎬, front-end web design 🌐, and mobile app development 📱. I enjoy exploring creative solutions and always aim to improve my skills in these areas. Building intuitive and visually appealing designs, along with crafting seamless user experiences, is something I truly love to do.

I'm always excited to learn new technologies 🧑‍💻 and stay updated with the latest trends in IT, as they fuel my passion for both personal projects and my future career. 🚀
